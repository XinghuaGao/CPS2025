# 2025 Workshop on Interdisciplinary Research on Cyber-Physical Systems: Applications, Security, and Education

## Workshop at a Glance
This workshop aims to inspire and empower CCI researchers interested in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications, cybersecurity, and engineering education to explore new ideas and discuss recent research challenges in the related areas. The workshop strives to foster future collaborations over past work presentations, offering a unique platform for seeding new partnerships and ideas. The event is funded by Commonwealth Cyber Initiative and is open to all researchers and students within [CCI networks](https://cyberinitiative.org/).

The workshop brings together researchers from diverse domains to explore interdisciplinary approaches to CPS research. Key topics include: (1) emerging CPS applications in healthcare, smart built environments, and robotics; (2) CPS security and resilience strategies; and (3) educational frameworks for training the next generation of CPS professionals. Through presentations, discussions, and collaborative sessions, participants will gain valuable insights into advancing CPS innovation, mitigating risks, and enhancing workforce development.

The workshop will take place on **`Friday, April 4th, 2025, from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM`**. Registered participants can attend the workshop in person at the **`Gilbert Place, Room 4001 (tentative), at Virginia Tech`**.
